ClayCode Tutorials
===================

In this section, we will show how to set up the following systems:

- Wyoming :ref:`Montmorillonite <mmt_tutorial>`
- :ref:`Illite <ill_tutorial>`
- :ref:`Pyrophyllite <pyro_tutorial>`
- Uley :ref:`Nontronites <non_tutorial>`
- :ref:`Ferruginous Smectite <fe_sm_tutorial>`
- :ref:`Kaolinite <kao_tutorial>`
- :ref:`Layered Double Hydroxide <ldh_tutorial>`

All necessary input files can be found in the :code:`Tutorial` directory. Each system has a corresponding .YAML file, and the :code:`exp_clay.csv` file contains clay structures corresponding to the `Clay Mineral Society`_'s Source Clays. :cite:p:`Sourceclays, Clays` Note, that Pyrophyllite's composition is not given in the .CSV file as it is fully described in the .YAML file.
