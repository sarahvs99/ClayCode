The Wyoming Montmorillonite is the most widely studied and used smectite. It is readily available for purchase from the Clay Mineral Society's `Source Clays`_, named SWy-1, SWy-2 or SWy-3 depending on when it was collected.

As it has been studied often, it is well characterised. The structure given by the Clay Mineral Society is:
