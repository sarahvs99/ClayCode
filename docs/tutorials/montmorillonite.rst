Montmorillonite
================

The Wyoming Montmorillonite is the most widely studied and used smectite. It is readily available for purchase from the Clay Mineral Society's `Source Clays`_, named SWy-1, SWy-2 or SWy-3 depending on when it was collected.

As it has been studied often, it is well characterised. The structure given by the Clay Mineral Society is:

.. math::

    Ca_{0.12} Na_{0.32} K_{0.05} [Si_{7.98} Al_{0.02} ]^{-0.02} [Al_{3.01} Fe^{III}_{0.41} Mn_{0.01} Mg_{0.54} Ti_{0.02} ]^{-0.53} O_{20} (OH)_4
    \text{with an unbalanced charge of +0.05}
